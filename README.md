# stream-proxy
A simple pass-through proxy for inspecting or logging TCP network streams with .NET Core 2.

Some of the included unit tests assume that Redis is installed, but not the Proxy itself.

Pull requests welcome, especially for performance improvements and cross-platform compatibility, as this is merely a demo and so far was developed and used only on Windows.
